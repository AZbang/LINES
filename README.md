# LINES

> A geometric puzzle made in a minimalist style, in which you have to use logic and skill to solve problems without knowing the goal. Over time, the game becomes more complicated, introducing new possibilities and combinations. I am sure that with each complete level you will be more and more proud of myself, because it's really hard! 

> This game is an open source project.
